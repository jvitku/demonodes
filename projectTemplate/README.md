HANNS project - Nodes for [....]
================================================

Author Jaroslav Vitku [vitkujar@fel.cvut.cz]


About
------

Helper for launching java-based implementation of ROS core from [rosjava_core](https://github.com/rosjava/rosjava_core) on unix-based systems. 


About Nengoros
---------------

This repository is a part of Hybrid Artificial Neural Network Systems (HANNS) project (see: [Nengoros pages](http://nengoros.wordpress.com) or [Our research](http://artificiallife.co.nf/) ). 

Each node can be connected into a potentially heterogeneous network of nodes communicating via the [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/), potentially [Nengoros](http://nengoros.wordpress.com). 

This is ROS meta-package (currently without direct catkin support), a collection of ROS(java) nodes.


Usage

Technical Notes
------------------

The best way how to install the Jroscore is to use them as a part of the [Nengoros](https://github.com/jvitku/nengoros) project. 

But, since this package depends only on rosjava\_core, it can be used without Nengoros.
